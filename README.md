This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Visit [the live site](https://notbnb.vercel.app/) or clone this repository and run it locally on your machine!

## Motivation
This application follows closely [a walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_-b_isI4vg). I chose this walkthrough to follow due to the elegant component architecture it employs, and this structure is one I've adopted in my subsequent work as well.
Additionally, I gained more comfort and knowledge with TailwindCSS and with OAuth, which is a first for me.
